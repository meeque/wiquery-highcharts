Topicus WHighCharts  (meeque's Fork)
====================================

This is my Fork of hielkehoeve's WHighCharts from:
https://github.com/hielkehoeve/wiquery-highcharts

The intention of this fork is to become a plain Java-bindings library for Highcharts, without all the Wicket and wiquery stuff. 

While I intend to use Highcharts with Wicket and jQuery, I believe Java-bindings and Wicket-Integration should be separated. 
So I'm trying to build on top of the work of others, and first improve the Java-bindings part. The goal is, to provide well-typed
Java-wrappers for most configuration objects used by Highcharts. And to provide basic, implementation-independent support for event-handlers. 

This is still work in progress. While I've modified the code for quite a while now, I'm only starting to make my changes publicly available. 
Also, I'm new to Git, so bear with me, even though I'm not making optimal use of it!
